# wordrubric
VBA script to create, highlight and save individual feedback forms with word/excel

## How it works
This works by taking a set of results in a formatted excel spreadsheet and merging them with a pre-defined template in word. The VBA hijacks the mail to individual documents process to highlight cells in a rubric table and then save the results to individual PDF's.
